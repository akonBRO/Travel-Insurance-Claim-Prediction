# Travel Insurance Claim Prediction 🧳

This project builds a machine learning model that predicts whether a customer will claim travel insurance based on demographic and trip-related data.

## 📂 Project Overview

The notebook includes:
- Data preprocessing and cleaning  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Feature encoding and scaling  
- Model training using multiple classifiers  
- Model evaluation and accuracy comparison  

## 📊 Dataset

Features include:
- Age, Employment Type, Graduate Status  
- Annual Income, Family Members  
- Frequent Flyer Status, Travelled Abroad  
- Target: Travel Insurance Claim (Yes/No)

## 🧠 Models Used

- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Neural Network
- Random Forest Classifier  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## 📈 Results

Each model is evaluated using:
- Accuracy Score  
- Confusion Matrix  
- Classification Report  

## 🛠️ Requirements

Install required libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn 
```
## ▶️ How to Run
Run the notebook using:

```bash
jupyter notebook "Travel Insurance Claim Prediction.ipynb"
```
Execute all cells step by step.
