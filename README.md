Travel Insurance Claim Prediction 🧳🧠
This project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a customer will claim travel insurance based on demographic and trip-related data.

📂 Project Overview
The notebook includes:

Data preprocessing and cleaning

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Feature encoding and scaling

Model training using multiple classifiers

Model evaluation and accuracy comparison

📊 Dataset
The dataset contains customer information such as:

Age, employment type, and graduate status

Annual income, family members

Frequent flyer status and ever traveled abroad

Travel insurance claim history (Target)

🧠 Models Used
Logistic Regression

Decision Tree Classifier

Random Forest Classifier

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

📈 Results
The models are evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report. The notebook selects the best-performing model for the task based on these metrics.

🛠️ Requirements
Install the following Python packages:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
▶️ How to Run
Open the notebook using Jupyter Notebook:

bash
Copy
Edit
jupyter notebook "Travel Insurance Claim Prediction.ipynb"
Follow the code blocks sequentially to preprocess the data and train the model.

📌 Future Improvements
Hyperparameter tuning for better accuracy

Cross-validation

Use of more advanced models (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM)

Deployment as a web app
